It will be useful to add to our objective function a small penalty for cases where either $\\Delta x$ or $\\Delta P$ are very large (we want to avoid this because we want to know $x$ and $p$ both pretty well and this helps the optimization because there is a subtle issue with our discretization as $\\Delta x \\rightarrow 0$ and $\\Delta p$ gets very large).
