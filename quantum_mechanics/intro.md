The formalism of quantum mechanics can sometimes look foreboding.  One way to make progress in understanding physics is to teach it to a computer.  This is particularly powerful in quantum mechanics where often the mathematics obscures a number of fundamental concepts.  Below are the computational assignments for for Physics 486 and (coming soon) Physics 487.  They are designed both to help your conceptual understanding of quantum mechanics as well as further develop computational thinking and wherewithall that will serve you well in the future.
