    "So far we've done dynamics by evaluating $\\exp[-i \\Delta t H]$ for a finite $\\Delta t$. This has the advantage of being the exact dynamics but when $L$ is large or $\\Delta x$ is small this gets very expensive to calculate limiting our ability to do interesting calculations. \n",

    "\n",
    "Instead of thinking of time-evolution as applying the exponential of the Hamiltonian, we can think of time evolution as alternatively applying the exponential of the potential and kinetic terms. \n",
    "\n",
    "If our wave-function is a vector in the position basis (which it mainly has been), then applying the potential term is very easy because multiplying by a diagonal matrix is the same as pointwise multiplying by a vector - i.e.  all three of these lines below are equivalent:\n",

    "np.diag(np.exp(-1.j*dt*V)) @ psi\n",
    "np.exp(-1.j*dt*V) * psi\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first line is the sort of thing we've been doing all along (but just with the potential piece).\n",
    "The last line doesn't involve a matrix at all but just a vector.  Let us define `M_half_x=np.exp(-1.j*dt/2*np.diag(V))` \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the potential piece is complicated if our wave-function is in the position basis. But.... if our wave-function is in the momentum basis, then it would be easy because in the momentum basis that matrix is diagonal so we can just pointwise multiply by the vector `M_p=np.exp(-1.j* dt* -(ks**2)/(2*m))`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it's easy to move the wave-function back and forth between the position and momentum basis via an FFT so we can always be in the \"good\" basis when we have to apply the operator. \n",
    "\n",
    "This leaves us with the following algorithm to apply a single time-step $\\Delta t$ starting with a wave-function `psi` in the position basis:\n",
    "* (1) apply  M_half_x to psi \n",
    "* (2) apply  M_half_x to psi \n",

    "* (4) apply M_p to psi_k\n",
    "* (5) switch to the real space basis `psi=np.fft.ifft(psi_k)`\n",
    "\n",
    "We then need to do this over and over again for many time-steps  (for technical reasons, it's actually more accurate to put (1) after (5)).\n",
    "\n",
    "You are making a tiny error in $\\Delta t$ but this algorithm is much better then our previous approaches.  You never need to build a big matrix diagonalize a Hamiltonian, etc.  To implement this you will need the k-vectors `ks=np.fft.fftfreq(len(xs), delta_x)*(2*np.pi)`\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one additional wart.  This will only work on wave-functions that go to zero at the edge of your box but since you can use such a large box this shouldn't be a problem. \n"
