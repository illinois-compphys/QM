Given that we know that there is an exponential decay of the eigenstate in the forbidden region, one interesting thing to look at is the minimum value of the eigenstate around zero.  One way to look at this is to do `np.min(np.abs(v[:,0][mask]))` where `mask=np.logical_and(xs>-5,xs<5)` is centered away from 10 and -10 where it gets tiny simply because of the hard walls there.   \n",

But.... if our wave-function is in the momentum basis, then it would be easy because in the momentum basis that matrix is diagonal so we can just pointwise multiply by the vector `M_p=np.exp(-1.j* dt* (ks**2)/(2*m))`.\n",
